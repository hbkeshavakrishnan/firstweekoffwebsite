                <h1>Stay in Goa</h1>
           <p>India’s smallest state has been the country’s prime tourist region since the Hippy Trail of the 1960s. As well as glorious beaches, inviting bars, and a laidback lifestyle to rival Bali and Thailand, Goa offers what is rarely (or ever) found elsewhere in India: manageable traffic and crowds, minimal pollution, spicy cuisine dominated by meat and seafood, water sports, loosely-regulated nightclubs, and very cheap alcohol. It also boasts a Portuguese colonial heritage of forts, food, and religion far more evident than the leftovers and legacies from the British Raj.

                <br><br>Goa more than doubles its population with tourists – mostly Indian, not foreign – and is busy and expensive during peak times (December and January), yet comparatively deserted during the monsoon (June to September). While most of the fifteen or so major beach regions provide top-end hotels, trendy boutiques, and/or chic yoga retreats, it’s still possible to find empty beaches and untouched fishing villages.</p>

                                    <li>Best Areas in Goa for Beaches: Cavelossim and Mobor
                                        <br>It’s quite impossible to choose the finest because there are so many and visitors have different preferences depending on, for example, attractiveness, facilities, activities, and convenience. Cavelossim and nearby Mobor tick all the right boxes like many others: glorious beaches (and surprisingly uncrowded in places), tempting cafés on the sand, and stunning sunsets. Unlike others, however, these adjoining beaches are close-ish to the airport, accessible by local bus, and provide compact areas of modern facilities, including resorts virtually on the beach.</li> 
                                    <li>Best Area in Goa for Water Sports: Baga
                                        <br>A range of activities such as jet-skiing and parasailing are available at several beach areas, but the variety and standards are not like those found in Thailand or Bali. One popular and convenient area that offers a better-than-average selection at not-too-overpriced rates is Baga, where more sedate banana-boat rides are also available. Elsewhere across the state, enthusiasts may also enjoy kayaking in the various rivers, surfing at Ashwem and Arambol, kite-surfing in Mandrem, and scuba-diving organized from agencies at Calangute and Baga. Note: No water sports will be available during the monsoon season (June to September) and, possibly, a month before and after.</li>
                                    <li>Best Areas in Goa for other Outdoor Activities: Candolim and Calangute
                                        <br>As well as the range of water sports listed above, extensive activities are also offered in many areas: e.g. boat trips from the capital, Panaji, along Mandovi River (where crocodiles appear harmlessly), paragliding at Arambol, rafting down Mhadei River, guided walks through national parks and sanctuaries, rides on ATV quad bikes, and dolphin-spotting at Palolem. These are best organized through any of the numerous travel agencies in Candolim and Calangute, but most activities would not be available during the monsoon (June to September) and, possibly, a month before and after.</li>
                                    <li>Best Area in Goa for Sightseeing: Panaji (Panjim)
                                        <br>Of course, the beaches are the overwhelming attraction, so few visitors venture more than a few hundred meters from the sea and shops. While a few forts can be found along the coastline, most of the actual sights – e.g. whitewashed churches, colonial-era gardens, and worthwhile museums – are in central Goa. The former capital, now called Old Goa, is dotted with remnants of Portuguese rule, but many are frustratingly neglected. More appealing is the old Latin Quarter of the current capital, Panaji, where river cruises can also be arranged and overnight stays in lovingly-renovated and centuries-old guesthouses can be booked.</li>
